          <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
        </header>

        <p>Paragraphs, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, are used to represent textual content. Two examples of this element are found below, which have been separated from this paragraph with the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>-element.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Geralt was always going to stand out, with his white hair and piercing eyes, his cynicism and lack of respect for authority&hellip; but he is far more than just a striking-looking man. He’s a witcher; his sorcerous powers, enhanced by elixirs and long training, have made him a brilliant fighter and a merciless assassin. Yet he is no ordinary murderer: his targets are the vile fiends that ravage the land. But first appearances are often deceptive. Not everything monstrous-looking is evil, and not everything fair is good&hellip; and in every fairy tale, there is a grain of truth.</p>
        <p>As a guardian of the innocent, Geralt, the witcher from Rivia, meets incestuous kings with undead daughters, vengeful djinns, shrieking harpies, lovelorn vampires and despondent ghouls: many are pernicious, some are wicked, and none are quite as they appear&hellip;</p>

        <p>Paragraphs that are quoted from external sources can also be presented as quotes with the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>-element.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred. I'm not a pious hermit, I haven't done only good in my life. But if I'm to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all.</p>

          <h3>Lists</h3>
        </header>

        <p>Lists can be represented in two different ways depending on their content.</p>

        <section>
          <header>
            <h4>Ordered lists</h4>
          </header>

          <p>These lists, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, and their direct children, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, are used to present ordered content, e.g. not-so-arbitrary rankings of people in the Witcher-universe.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <h5>Sorceresses</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>Vengerberg, Yennefer</li>
                <li>Merigold, Triss</li>
                <li>Eilhart, Philippa</li>
                <li>Vigo, Fringilla</li>
                <li>Metz, Keira</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Witchers</h5>
              <ol>
                <li>Cirilla</li>
                <li>Geralt</li>
                <li>Eskel</li>
                <li>Lambert</li>
                <li>Vesemir</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
          <header>
            <h4>Unordered lists</h4>
          </header>

          <p>These lists, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, and their direct children, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, are used to present unordered content, i.e. lists where the order is unimportant; e.g. lists to use for navigational information, or really any kind of list-based content.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h5>Nilfgaardian Empire</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Cintra</li>
                <li>Ebbing</li>
                <li>Metinna</li>
                <li>Nilfgaard</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>Redania</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Drakenborg</li>
                <li>Oxenfurt</li>
                <li>Tretogor</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <header>
            <h4>Definition lists</h4>
          </header>
    
          <p>An extra step beyond <i>“regular”</i> lists are definitions lists, <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>, where terms, <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>, are described by one or more definitions, <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code>.</p>
    
          <dl>
            <dt>Aen Ithlinnespeath</dt>
            <dd>A prediction made by the elven prophetess <i>Ithlinne</i>. It is mentioned over the course of the Witcher series, and it is tied to the computer games rather prominently.</dd>
            <dt>Witcher</dt>
            <dd>An individual who has undergone extensive training and mysterious rituals (often taking place at <i>&ldquo;witcher schools&rdquo;</i> such as <i>Kaer Morhen</i>) in preparation for life as an itinerant monster-slayer for hire.</dd>
          </dl>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <header>
          <h3>Pre-formatted text</h3>
        </header>

        <p>The <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>-element is useful for representing textual content that is dependent on an established formatting, e.g. source code you wish to share with others.</p>
        <pre>require 'sinatra'

class Frank &lt;&lt; Sinatra::Base
  get '/' do
    'Hello, world!'
  end
end</pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <header>
          <h3>Tabular elements</h3>
        </header>

        <p>Tabular elements, which are listed below, are useful for presenting tabular data, i.e. information that is two-dimensional and representable by columns and rows.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, the parent element for all tabular elements</li>
          <li><code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, the element representing the table's header</li>
          <li><code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code>, the element representing the table's footer</li>
          <li><code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, the element which contains all rows and their column values <i>(cells)</i></li>
          <li><code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, the row-element</li>
          <li><code>&lt;th&gt;</code>, the header-element for a specific column</li>
          <li><code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, the cell-element for a specific column</li>
        </ul>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Column A</th>
              <th>Column B</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tfoot>
            <tr>
              <td>Summary of A</td>
              <td>Summary of B</td>
            </tr>
          </tfoot>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>First value for column A</td>
              <td>First value for column B</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Second value for column A</td>
              <td>Second value for column B</td>
            </tr>

          <h3>Images</h3>
        </header>

        <p>Images can be included with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>-element, where the <code>&lt;src&gt;</code>-attribute determines the origin of the image; the <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code>-attribute <em>should always</em> be used to assist in describing the image for accessibility purposes, unless it is used decoratively.</p>

        <img src="//via.placeholder.com/1600x400" alt="A grey placeholder image.">

        <hr>

        <p>To present images &ndash; or other forms of media &ndash; in a contained way with accompanying elements, the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>-element can act as parent containing the image and other elements, e.g. <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> for captions.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="//via.placeholder.com/1600x400" alt="">
          <figcaption>Caption for a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>-based image.</figcaption>

          <h3>Emboldening &amp; italicising</h3>
        </header>

        <p>The bold and italic elements, <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, are used to embolden or italicise text without ascribing semantics to them <i>(unlike the two previous elements)</i>.</p>
        <p>Emboldening is often used to denote keywords in a summary or product names in an article, while italicising is used for technical terms, foreign language phrases, or fictional character thoughts.</p>
        <p>The Witcher saga takes place in the aftermath of the first major war between the <b>Nilfgaard Empire</b> and the <b>Northern Kingdoms</b>, with a second war beginning in the middle of the series.</p>
        <p>Geralt of Rivia, known also as <i>Gwynnbleid</i> (Elder Speech: <i>“White Wolf”</i>) and the <i>Butcher of Blaviken</i>, is the protagonist of the series and its adaptations. </p>

          <h3>Variables</h3>
        </header>

        <p>The variable element, <code>&lt;var&gt;</code>, is used to represent names of variables in a mathemical or programmatical environment.</p>
        <p>In the special and general theories of relativity, <var>c</var> interrelates space and time, and also appears in the famous equation of mass–energy equivalence <var>E</var> = <var>m</var><var>c</var><sup><var>2</var></sup>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>

        <p>The sub- and superscript elements, <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code>, are purely typographical elements and are used to denote stylistic standards, e.g. within chemical formulas.</p>
        <p>The molecular formula for glucose is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> <i>(meaning that it is a molecule with 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms and 6 oxygen atoms)</i>.</p>
        <p>Ordinal indicators are sometimes written as superscripts; 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> <i>(rather than 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th)</i>.</p>
