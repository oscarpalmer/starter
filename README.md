# 🏝&nbsp;&nbsp;Starter

A simple starter pack for _“lo-fi”_ web development.

## What is this?

This is a repository of files for when I start basic web development projects, usually as complements to _JavaScript_ projects or other things that need to be demonstrated in a simple way.

## Getting started

Just grab one of the _“important”_ files listed below and use them however you like.

### Styleguide

To check out the styleguide, download this repo and then open [`styleguide.html`](styleguide.html) in your browser or _“start a local server”_ (in your _CLI_) with its folder as the root (I like _PHP's_ for simple stuff: `php -S localhost:1234`).

## Important files

- [`index.html`](index.html): a basic _HTML_-template with some accessibility stuff
- [`reset.css`](reset.css): a _CSS_-reset for quickly getting started with styling

### Not so important files

- [`styleguide.html`](styleguide.html): a visual guide of elements and their default styling with this reset-file
- [`styles.css`](styles.css): basic styles for when this repo is visited in a browser
